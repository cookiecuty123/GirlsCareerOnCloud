## Short Description of Project

Girls Career on cloud is a web-based application tailored to rural communities in helping them set up virtual education centers for young girls in order to improve their education. Virtual classrooms
Girls Career on Cloud is a web-based application tailored to helping young girls in rural communities receive further education. This education would be in the format of virtual classrooms set up by organizers and teachers to teach a variety of subjects.
  
## How do you get the idea to build the project?

We got the idea for this application project by reading online news about how efforts in the world have hit obstacles in bringing more education to young girls in rural communities. While males are usually supported in their efforts to seek higher education, young girls in these communities are frequently not given the same opportunity and support in this endeavor. In these communities, limited finances have pushed them to only send their best men to urban centers for further education. As such, we sought to think about a potential solution or at least an avenue for these girls to attain more education. Thus, we came up with the idea of a simple website that can help rural communities set up virtual and onsite education centers tailored to these young girls.

We got the idea for this project by reading about how recent efforts around the world have met obstacles in helping improve the education of young girls in rural communities. Most often, some rural communities mostly only sent boys to urban centers for urban education, not giving the same opportunities to their young girls and girls due to limited financial support. Therefore, we as a team, sought to think about a possible solution to this issue, seeking a method to help teach these young girls in these communities. Therefore, we came up with the idea of a simple website that can assist these rural communities in setting up virtual and onsite education centers tailored to help these young girls receive the higher education they deserve.
  
## What is the purpose of the app?

The purpose of this website is to assist rural communities in educating their young girls by allowing them to gain more knowledge and skills in a safe, virtual environment to catch up with their male peers. It seeks to create virtual classrooms for teachers and students under the watch of educational organizations to reach educational standards and provide resources for these students for further education and additional career paths.

## How is it beneficial to society?

Girls Carrer on Cloud is beneficial to society as it seeks to help educate young female students in order for them to have better futures. More education and training for these bright students can help achieve careers, which brings about more benefits to these communities. Better educated girls can help build stronger families, earn higher wages, reduce poverty, and generally improve the workings of local economies as a result of higher education.
Girl's Career on Cloud is beneficial to society in many ways. The webpage seeks to help educate young female students in rural communities around the world, leading to future benefits for not only them but also their communities. First, more education and training for these promising students can lead them to achieve future careers that can help rural communities. Better education for these young girls and girls can help build stronger families, with the higher levels of wages that reduce the amount of poverty in these communities and generally improve local economies with higher purchasing power.
 
## Challenges we ran into

One big challenge We faced when developing this project is how to connect web portals for teachers, students, tutors and organizers on the website. I had two minds about this particular issue. Should we keep these screens separate while coding these segments of the project or should we find a solution to join these portals together in a template to simplify the issue. Generally, the issue of coding a more complex web page brings about more complications, no matter how a skill a programmer is with any programming language or project suite.
One significant challenge we faced as a team when developing this project was figuring how to connect web portals for teachers, students, tutors and organizers for the web application. We were conflicted on this particular issue. We discuss if we should keep these screens separate while coding these segments or should the team find a solution to join these portals together in a template to simplify the issue. The matter with coding is that a more complex web page brings generally more complications in coding to any programmer of any skill level no matter the programming or project suite.

A second challenge we faced as a team was coordinating and adjusting to the amount of effort and time to make sure our code was functional and complete. There was a significant amount of time spent double-checking, and at one point, we had to start over with a different framework to complete this project. Many times, we face significant challenges that delay or completely stop projects which lead to discouragement. Still, when dealing with a passion project or work that must be complete, it is best for everyone to keep pushing through and finish the work to the best of your abilities.  

## Accomplishments that I am proud of?

The accomplishment we are most proud of is able to code such a complicated web app such as this project. This application requires many systems to function properly, and as such can be quite an issue to keep tracking in coding and testing such functions. Especially since our initial attempt at making this web page fell apart in the middle of the project. We felt We had to scramble more in the less time We had to finish this project.
The accomplishment we as a team are more proud of during this project is that we were able to code such a complex web application. This web application requires many systems to function properly, which led to issues in keeping track of coding and testing various functions. This is notable when considering that our initial efforts in completing this project fell apart halfway through the initial project. As such, we felt that we had to scramble and work harder in the less time we had in order to complete the project.

## What did I learn?

We learned from the previous application projects that proper planning, time schedule, double-checking work, and other such efforts must be at the forefront in mind when working on such a project. This is especially important when something unexpected happens, and you have to start nearly all over again. This can be quite nerve-racking and can lead to despair. But, once you set yourself to start over again, you must cross the finish line even if you come in last place.

As a team, we learn that from previous projects involving mobile and web applications, the importance of time management when we develop and complete a project. Proper planning, maintaining a strict schedule, double-checking work, and code, and similar efforts must be on the forefront in the minds of a team or individual working on such a project. This is especially important when the unexpected happens, which could lead to such effort and work being wasted on an initial attempt. Such misfortune can lead to despair and a lack of confidence. However, once you set yourself to complete something, it always best to finish the race even if you come in the last place.
 
## Summary

In summary, we can discuss the main points of this presentation of this project application. First, the purpose of the Girls Career on Cloud is to help young rural girls, who often lag behind their male peers in education, the opportunity to expand their students through virtual classrooms online. The features of this web app would help assist in reaching that goal. The app has a classroom portal and interface that allows teachers and students to have classes online. It also has listings of class, educational, and career resources tailored to these young female students. By improving the education of these young girls, rural communities, and the world at large will reap the benefits. The benefits include these girls receiving better education and skills to pursue better careers, earning higher wages, and better chances to help their local communities as experts in their fields of study. While this sounds like a great web page, it is obviously not the only application that has a virtual classroom online portal. One such example is Class Dojo, which shares many of the same features as Girls Career on Cloud, but it is tailored to a younger and general audience. It does not have the links to resources that can help young rural careers to succeed in their studies.

To summarize, we can discuss the main points of this presentation of this project. First, the purpose of the Girls Career on Cloud web application is to help young girls from rural communities around the world the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skills through virtual classrooms online. This project is based on the objective is to help these young girls and woman to catch up with their male peers, who often did have the opportunity to enter higher education. Web applications have several features to help these students. First, the web has a virtual classroom portal and interface that allows students and teachers to have classes online. Furthermore, this application also has features such as class listings, educational material, and career resources for students to partake in furthering their education. By improving the education of these young girls, not only would rural communities reap the benefits, but also the world in general. The benefits include more education and skills to students who can now achieve better careers, higher wages to support themselves and their families, and have better opportunities to help their local communities as educated experts in their field of study. As we discuss the benefits of such a goal, it is obvious that such an objective has precedent in the field of virtual.

## What will be next after this project?

After this building project as a functional website, I will look at different ways to improve and modify this web application in order to suit the needs of users. I will conduct more research into how to make the webpage more user-friendly to users, and see what new features can be implemented into the code and webpages. Launching and maintaining this website will require a great deal of effort, time, and resources, so it is best to consider what decisions we must take in launching such a project. By setting up and maintaining a donations page on the website, we can further support and develop Girls Career on Cloud if enough donations can come in. Those donations would be used to help support the website, and help students with further education.
